Title: I feel violated by intern season
Body: There's this bar that I frequent a few blocks away from my house. Technically different neighborhood, but generally has a mature vibe with people who like music and to dance. Today when I went to the bar and all of a sudden I felt like I was at a college basement party. I thought that I must have been hallucinating, but Then a girl pointed at me and referred to me as the old person. That's when I knew I had to get out of there.
 I was at the wrong party. 

As I walk back home, all of a sudden I realize that there were now tens of thousands of 18 year-old 19 year-old 20-year-olds who were all living on top of each other and were super young and horny to basically use the New York nightlife as their own personal orgy dome.
 Naturally I felt violated

But then again, I thought to myself. Am I not the same as they are, just at a longer time horizon? I'm also a transient being in the city. They might only be here for three months, but I've only been here for three years as well. As a matter fact, there are bunch of people have done this for generations where their parents and their grandparents and their grandparents all met in New York, and they all decided to live somewhere in the broader region whether it be Westchester, Wilmington, Big Indian, Boston, etc. 
New York City is equally adventurous to each, so who am I to judge how others enjoy this adventurous city.

Title: Would you guys like to see Pokemon Go in AVP?
Body: Hi guys,

I think Pokemon could be one of the killer use case for the vision pro. Imagine, you could fight players from around the world from the comfort of your couch. With the recent controversy around Palworld, they're looking for the next "Pokemon Go" that would propel their franchise to the next level.

Being Japanese, I happen to know a few key decision makers both in the Pokemon Company as well as Niantic. Alot of the in-game designs are transferrable, and I believe it's a matter of time until Niantic's Lightship ARDK will work on AVP.

*What should I tell them? Lmk if you have thoughts or useful links/videos I should forward to them.*

I'm confident that this will eventually become a thing, but the faster they ship the more AVP adoption we'll see.

Title: Can you actually “work” in AVP?
Body: I’m curious if people have been able to fully port their workflow into AVP.

I’ve been trying to actually use the Vision Pro to get some work done, but without github and visual studio code, it’s not been the easiest (also obviously no terminal). I could use Mac virtual display, but since I have a M1 MBP the latency is noticeable to the point it’s an adverse experience. I already dropped $4k on this device, renewing my MBP just so I can use it with my AVP is asking a bit too much…

Also where’s Xcode? If Apple wants AVP to be a “work device”, they gotta have at least Xcode right?

I can get the simple stuff like emails done through AVP, but if this device can’t replace my entire workflow, I don’t know if I can justify the price. I’m sure it’ll get resolved down the line (more of a software issue than hardware constraints), but curious to hear how realistic it is for people to port over their workflow to AVP, and what apps you’d like to see ASAP.

Title: 【Theory】 What if we live in the void 800 century
Body: Let’s say the WG is the current western civilization. 

The birth of Western history is in the Middle East, specifically Iraq (Nippur). Which is why the west, led by the US, has been trying to cause instability, and destroy historical artifacts. That way, the true history of how the WG came to be won’t come into light. Like, archaeology is basically using artifacts discovered and interpreting it a certain way. The whole concept is something that mostly grew into a concept in the UK around 1824. 1824 is the year the Oxford English Dictionary defined "archaeology" a word.

(Btw our generation will be remembered for our new additions which include anti-work, curry laksa, diet-busting, final frontier, fugazi, gajillion, skellington, straight-talking, stonkingly, voguing,etc.)

Back to the main topic, what I’m saying is that it’s pretty easy for the “1%” to control the “story of our world” through archeologists and historians. These have traditionally been an activity for the rich and remains that way. Like, who tries to become a historian unless they have trust funds?

So yeah, maybe the history we are told on a daily basis is pretty different from reality, and Oda is trying to tell us this message.

What are pacifistas? They're our modern comparable to AI. They will be the ultimate, infinite, obedient, power between the celestial dragons (also known as the 1%) and us normal humans.

So who is our Nika? Who is our Joy Boy? are we too early to hear the drums of liberation, or do we actually all have our own drums of liberation?

Title: Tracking our individual impacts on the world through ESG ratings
Body: &#x200B;

[Mock-up of ESG scores ](https://preview.redd.it/btc0a5nqmhjb1.png?width=632&format=png&auto=webp&s=13920d7c88791b2579b6167e5fe135a136731ef7)

&#x200B;

We've had ESG ratings for decades now, but it hasn't  played a significant role in the eyes of the consumer. Sure it has developed new investing policies and has made some impact from the shareholder side, but as someone who's worked in environmental consulting, I felt that we needed a more direct way of getting ESG ratings into the mass conscience.

**Do you think individuals should be aware of our own ESG rating?**

I feel that companies would take ESG ratings  seriously if consumers changed their purchase behaviors based on the score.

The current method of consumer activism has yielded lackluster results. This is because once the news dies down, consumers forget about the scandal and go back to normal purchasing behavior. In addition, companies aren't really incentivized to make changes, since consumers hear about the scandal, but rarely stay informed about what was done about it.

The first step towards voting with our dollars is to be aware of our current ESG impact. This can be approximated through the ESG score of the companies you are purchasing goods/services from, multiplied by the dollar amount of your purchase. [Sustainalytics](https://www.sustainalytics.com/) has a comprehensive ESG rating for most public companies. For purchases from businesses that are private (and doesn't have any ESG rating), we can approximate from comparable public companies, or use other indicators (BCorp, Fair Trade, etc.)

Please let me know what you think!

Individual ESG scores could elevate sustainable conscience to another level, which would lead to climate activism on a larger scale.

Title: How do you decide what to buy and not buy?
Body: I've been lurking in this channel for a while now, and have been greatly inspired by the ways people have found ways to stretch their money. This got me thinking, is there a way to develop a mental model on what we buy or don't buy?

I feel that most people decide what to buy based on past experiences, gut feeling, or the mood of that day. But is there a way to better understand what we get our "gratification" from, and track this?

My initial idea was an app that would enable users to track the "gratification" they receive from their purchases. If you regret what you bought, you can record a decline in the gratification, or if you found the purchase better than you expected, you can record an increase.

Of course, this would not necessarily apply to all purchases. Some things (rent, insurance, etc.) do not yield any gratification scores, but many purchases (clothes, going out, etc.) could.

&#x200B;

Would love to hear how you make your purchase decisions, and if there's a mental model you follow!

(photo is a mockup of the idea I'm working on)

Body: I’ve been trading options for the past month or so, and have made good money.

Comment: That proximity is ridiculous, deep mining, two fishing huts, vegetable, orchards, and trade iron for malt.
imo trading raw materials is easier than trading crafted goods in the current build. High quantity stuff is easy to stock, and you could have multiple trading posts up without any major issues.
The exact opposite of this is plate armor. It takes forever to build, requires three points, and needs eight iron slabs to make it. It’s cheaper to just export the ore, and since it’s a low quantity trade, it’s hard to stick multiple trade posts with it

Subreddit: NFT
Comment: \- the hype has definitely faded, you can see that with the price as well as the number of people discussing it on X, or even here  
\- haven't seen much innovation in the space at all, the momentum seems to have shifted to solana memecoins, and dissipated after that  
\- again, people no longer seem interested. I found linksDAO to be an interesting concept of fractionally owning a golf course, and they're still active but not much hype around them anymore either. Most major brand NFT collaborations have died down as well  
\- the NFT craze has not settled into something sustainable, it's dead. Can it come back? Possibly, it has happened before, when cryptopunks and cryptokitties were first hot in 2017-ish, then died, then came back during 2020-2022.  
\- will there be a big boom? I personally don't think it would in the way we think of NFTs as collectables. A major thesis was around digital scarcity, and that seemed possible during covid, but post covid people went back to f2f interactions. Digital scarcity could become a hot topic again if we see a broader adoption of VR or even XR, but that seems a bit down the line. I think fractional ownership of assets could be interesting, but they'd just be fungible tokens, not NFT

I see so many one-off posts on this community with only a couple responses. Can't believe there's 2.7M members here. That alone should tell you that NFTs are no longer something people are interested in. I'd love to be proven wrong, since I feel that there was alot of potential, but so far it seems like the community is dead

Comment: I’m definitely done after curry. It was awesome seeing an underdog like him demolish taller players, revolutionize the game with his 3pt shooting.
Wemby is an alien, but I can’t cheer for him the way I could for curry since it’s almost a given that tall players have an advantage (although 7ft+ players have their own longevity challenges). 
Oh and the proliferation of gambling definitely doesn’t help either. As a matter of fact, there’s way too many ad breaks. 

Cut the number of ads in half, make consistent ref calls, and get gambling out of the league. But we know none of those are happening, so I’m definitely out.

URL: https://reddit.com/r/civ5/comments/1h7bmv3/flight_deity/m0lub7c/

Subreddit: civ5
Comment: The optimal strategy I've discovered is the following

1. rush artist/writer slots and fill them
2. rush renaissance era via acoustics
3. bulb writer to fill rationalism slots
4. if AI wants to be friends, accept (unless negative impact with neighboring civs) and do research agreement
5. internal food routes (usually to city with artist slots)
6. pay neighbors to fight eachother (so you don't get attacked)
7. rush and work science buildings
8. 7 turns (10 if standard speed) after building and rushing research lab (and working the slot), bulb science, beeline for stealth bombers. (if you have a religion use faith to buy 3-4 scientists)
9. if you have the capacity, build out military buildings (up to military academy) so you have air repair
10. go dominate or yeet off to space

I'm usually ahead of AI by the time I build research labs (although they may have more total techs since they fill the science tree more balanced), and left them in the dust when I bulb

It does get a bit boring after a while though, so I'm trying to find ways to diversify the gameplay.

It might also be the type of people I’m attracted to though. I’ve noticed those in their early 20s aren’t really good at conversations, or get more matches so they don’t care as much.

Try to go on the first day if you can, since they do sell out quickly. Be ready to wait an hour or two.

Comment: First of all you look good! But if you want to become more "conventionally attractive", here are some of my suggestions. Just personal opinions, take them or leave them.

  
**Do away with glasses -** 

Have you considered contacts? If not you should look into it. Or lasik although that's a bit pricy (and scary to some). I did it and was the best decision ever.

  
**Work out -** 

make sure to get enough protein and look into creatine as well

I'd recommend losing weight though cardio & eating healthier, as well as build muscle though bench and squats. Don't forget to stretch too since you can injure yourself! And get a gym rat to spot you. Once you start losing weight you'll see your face slim down as well

**Fashion -** 

Uniqlo is a good start, but you gotta dress well in Uniqlo

[https://www.instagram.com/steelojeem/reel/C\_oENHCPkft](https://www.instagram.com/steelojeem/reel/C_oENHCPkft)

(If you're in Japan just buy them there it's cheaper haha)

I wouldn't recommend you wearing anime related items if you're trying to be "conventionally attractive". Make it something very subtle, like a tiny totoro tattoo on your wrist, or a ring which doesn't shout ANIMEEEEE! Also if someone asks your about it you can elaborate on your interest, but keep it short and succinct so you don't nerd out until you know they are interested in learning more.

If you can afford it, go one layer above and try Cos

[https://www.cos.com/en\_usd/men.html](https://www.cos.com/en_usd/men.html)



**Eyebrows** **-** 

Go get your brows done at an Indian threading place. Take a picture of it, and try to recreate it via shaver below

[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079M8D8Y9/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_search\_asin\_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079M8D8Y9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

  
**Skincare -** 

You seem to be on the oily side like me. Wash your face daily, and use a decent face cream and serum. Here's the ones I use.

[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N7T7JKJ/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_search\_asin\_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N7T7JKJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

**Hair** \- 

Honestly I don't know. You could grow it out, shave it, or keep as is. If you're going to shave it keep the beard because you gotta keep one of them. If you're worried about balding there's these crazy services in Turkey where they will regrow your hair (example below). My colleague did it and he looked messed up for a month but now looks amazing (not at this particular spot).

[https://cosmedica.com/](https://cosmedica.com/)

  
Last but not least, get yourself out there! Getting experience with women/men whoever you are attracted to, is the best way to build confidence. Make mistakes, learn, and grow as a person.

Wishing the best for you!

Comment: There are some key technologies which can give you significant advantage in the early game, either in military or in science. The ones for military are composite Bowmans, chariots, crossbow etc, but the great library doesn’t really help you obtain these since they’re on the opposite side of the tech tree. As in, if you want to beeline for those it’s faster to research those tech instead of researching and beelining for great library.

I think the great library can be beneficial in getting to theology faster, which will get you to borobudur. That’s game changing if you are pushing for religion (which honestly you should unless there are reasons not to). 

The great scientist points are great to have early on, although you often use them for bulk popping once you have research labs up and running.

I usually play at deity where the AI starts miles ahead in technology so don’t even bother, but if you’re playing king or emperor it should be a decent strat.

Comment: It’s a combination of multiple factors, your military strength, the amount of GPT/luxury you can offer, their military might, the other civ’s might, etc.
What seems to impact it the most is how bloodthirsty the AI is. Shaka will go to war with almost anyone, it’s impossible to get Ghandi to attack, unless he’s got nukes. I feel that it’s balanced considering that the violent civs tend to attack you, and those are the ones you can bribe relatively easily.
Even if the civs aren’t neighbors, if you can get them to declare war on one another they will most likely not attack you, which is already a win. You have the largest disadvantage at the beginning of the game, so it’s easier to catch up as you invest the resources to non-military infrastructure, while your competitors burn hammers on swords and arrows.

Comment: The founders may have had good intentions, but they definitely didn’t deliver on them. As for the brands that veve partnered with, they probably saw it more as a marketing opportunity, and considering how a few people care about NFTs, they see the impact of their apathy as negligible to the overall brand image. 
Disney for instance, have received way more flack about trying to use Disney+ terms and conditions on the victim who died in their theme park. 
The reality is that mainstream attention has moved away from NFTs (if there ever was any), and so they’ve written it off as one of the many, many things they’d like to sweep under the rug.
